  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Climate change is quite possibly the most pressing challenge facing humanity in the modern era. Itâ€™s an issue driven 
    largely by the rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations driven by anthropogenic sources, such as the burning 
    of fossil fuels and deforestation. While significant attention has been paid to the more obvious and dramatic effects, 
    like global warming and extreme weather events, a quieter but equally serious impact of rising CO2 levels is the 
    increase in ocean acidification. Ocean acidification results from atmospheric CO2 by ocean water, where it is 
    converted to carbonic acid, resulting in a net decrease in seawater pH.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ocean acidification can have significant impact on aquatic ecosystems, especially those with organisms that utilize 
    calcium carbonate to form essential structures (such as corals and shellfish). As pH level decrease, these organisms 
    face significant challenges in growing or maintaining these structures, which impacts their ability to survive and 
    reproduce. Given the crucial role many of these species play in their ecosystems (especially keystone species such as 
    coral), the impacts on other species can be significant. Understanding how CO2 levels correlate with changes in oceanic 
    pH is therefore important to predicting and mitigating these broader ecological impacts, as well as the potential 
    impacts to humans that rely on these ecosystems for food and commerce.

  <h3>10 Questions to Answer</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>How closely do atmospheric CO2 concentrations correlate with changes in average ocean surface pH over time?</li>
    <li>How does ocean acidification correlate with declines in specific marine species populations?</li>
    <li>What impact does ocean acidification have on global fishery populations?</li>
    <li>Are there other features in the data which may be predictive of future acidification?</li>
    <li>Is there a measurable lag between increases in atmospheric CO2 and corresponding changes in ocean pH?</li>
    <li>Is there a link between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and coral reef degradation in the Caribbean?</li>
    <li>How do temperature, salinity, and CO2 uptake interact to influence acidification?</li>
    <li>Are acidification trends more severe near coastal urban centers or areas with high tourism?</li>
    <li>How have natural carbon sinks in the Caribbean responded to changes in ocean acidity?</li>
    <li>Do hurricanes and extreme weather events play a role in short-term shift in ocean acidity?</li>
