  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    A good education is the foundation on which children and young adults build their lives and careers, with educational 
    outcomes historically strongly tied to eventual life outcomes. In the rapidly evolving political, technological, 
    and cultural landscapes of the modern world, education policy has been slow to adapt, and as a consequence many feel 
    that the quality of American primary education is suffering. Many differing strategies for organizing and funding 
    education at the national level in recent decades (most notably the Common Core and No Child Left Behind policies), 
    but opinion is divided on the efficacy of these schema, and many feel that they were already outdated the moment 
    they were rolled out.
  </p>
  <p>
    It should come as no surprise, then, that research into educational outcomes and their causes has been a priority in 
    academia and government for some time; as a consequence, significant sources of data are available to analyze the 
    problems we find in education. This provides an opportunity for the use of machine learning techniques to answer 
    questions related to modern education, as well as attempt to discern underlying patterns within the data that 
    researchers may not be looking directly for.

  <h3>10 Questions to Answer</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Can a studentâ€™s academic performance be predicted based primarily on demographic information?</li>
    <li>What are the strongest influencing factors in determining student dropout rates?</li>
    <li>What kinds of underlying clusters of students can I determine based on combinations of behavior, academic performance, demographic information, etc.?</li>
    <li>Can I build a model that will reliably predict students at risk of failure?</li>
    <li>What impact does parental education level have on student performance?</li>
    <li>Are there meaningful differences in gender-based performance by subject?</li>
    <li>What kinds of impact do school environment factors, such as class size, resources, and funding, have on student outcomes?</li>
    <li>Is there a strong relationship between student attendance and academic outcomes?</li>
    <li>Which interventions have been most effective for improving student outcomes for struggling students?</li>
    <li>Are standardized tests predictive of future success?</li>
